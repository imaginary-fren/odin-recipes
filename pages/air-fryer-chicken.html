    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>½ tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp garlic granules</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked sweet paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp mixed herbs</li>
        <li>½ tsp pepper</li>
        <li>steamed rice and greens such as broccoli or green beans or a green salad, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat the chicken in the oil and set aside. In a bowl, combine the salt, garlic, paprika and mixed herbs with a good grinding of black pepper, then scatter onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Roll each oiled chicken breast in the seasoning and put in your air fryer basket. Cook at 180C for 18-20 mins, turning after 10 mins. To check it is cooked, pierce the chicken with a knife at the thickest part to see if the juices run clear. Or insert a temperature thermometer and it should read 70C. Serve with rice and greens or a salad.</li>
    </ol>
